# Springboard_work
## Welcome!!
This space is a partial documentation of my journey towards becoming a data scientist. This respository mainly holds the mini-projects from the curriculum.<br>
Capstone 1 & 2 projects have their own repsitories under /ssatti0. They contain full documentation, including pdf *google slides*. Feel free to head over there for further exploration. I hope you enjoy learning about them as much as I have enjoyed working on them.
